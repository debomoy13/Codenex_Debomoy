In my code I have applied basics concepts of python.

Step 1 : I have initialised 5 variables (ie. a,b,c,d,e) which represents 5 subjects  (physics,chemistry,maths,computer,english respectively).


Step 2 : Calculated the total marks by adding a,b,c,d,e respectively.


Step 3 : Calculated the average marks by dividing the total marks by 5 since there are 5 subjects.


Step 4 : displayed both of them


UPTO STEP 4 I HAVE INDENTED THE CODE INTO A FUNCTION CALLED 'marks_details' FOR EASY ACCESS .

Step 5 : Using while loop i checked if the avg marks is less than 90 or not or eqaul to.



         I used while loop conditions as given in the question.
THIS STEP 5 IS ALSO INDENTED UNDER A NEW FUNCTION 'grade_of_student'



EXECUTION OF THE CODE
TO run this code copy my code from 'code.ipynb' and paste it in VS CODE or any other python compiler .
